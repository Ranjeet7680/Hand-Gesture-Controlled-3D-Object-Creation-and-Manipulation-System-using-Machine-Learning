# 🖐️ Hand Gesture Controlled 3D Object Creator (ML Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Machine Learning + Computer Vision based 3D Object Creation System** where users can create, move, rotate, scale, and change colors of 3D objects using **hand gestures** captured via a webcam.

The system uses **real-time hand tracking** to recognize gestures and maps them to actions in a **3D environment**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect human hand using webcam
- Recognize hand gestures using ML
- Create and manipulate 3D objects
- Provide touch-free interaction with 3D models
